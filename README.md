### [Software Engineering & Design](SoftwareEngineering_Design.md)
  This artifact originally a mobile application I created in Java using Android Studio. I created it in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The application allows a user to log in with their credentials, and you will access an inventory where you can manage items and their amount. The app would allow you to add or delete items, modify the item count, and notify you when an item got low. 
### [Data Structures & Algorithms](DataStructures_Algorithms.md)
  The database artifact was originally a binary search tree algorithm built in C++, and was rebuilt in the Java language. I created this algorithm in CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms. The algorithm allowed you to interact with the functionality by terminal. The program first reads a .csv file, parses it and organizes it into the tree, and then allows you to interact with the data. Users can print the contents, search for a specific item, and delete an item as well. Lastly, the effeciency of the algoritm is printed to the console in BigO notation.
### [Database](Database.md)
  This artifact also used the inventory application from the first artifact. In the back end, the database was optimized to differenciate between users, as well as add details to the inventory items. This involved restructuring the current database and updating the API calls that interacted with them.
